# American-Sign-language-to-english-text-converter

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a real-time sign language detection and translation system using computer vision. The system will be capable of recognizing hand gestures corresponding to various sign language phrases and translating them into text or spoken language.

Description:
The project involves two main components: hand sign detection and translation.

Hand Gesture Detection:

Utilizes OpenCV (cv2) library for real-time video capture and image processing.
Implements a hand detection algorithm using the HandTrackingModule from the cvzone library.
Detects the user's hand signs from the live video feed captured by the webcam.
Processes the hand region to extract relevant features for classification.

Sign Language Translation:

Employs a pre-trained deep learning model (possibly using Keras) for classification of hand gestures.
The model is trained to classify different hand gestures corresponding to specific sign language symbols.
Once a hand gesture is detected, it is classified using the trained model to determine the corresponding sign language phrase.
The detected symbol is translated into text or spoken language using predefined labels or a lookup table.
Additional Features:

Error handling: Checks for empty image crops or resized images to ensure robustness.
GUI Interface: Utilizes Tkinter for creating a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to start and close the application.
Logging: Prints diagnostic messages to the console for debugging purposes.
Modular Design: The code is organized into classes and functions for clarity and modularity.
Overall, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for real-time sign language detection and translation, making communication more accessible for individuals with hearing impairments.
